--Exercises of the free course SQL for Data Analysis provided by the website Udacity. Nice to review concepts and practice the PotsgreSQL sintaxe.

--select everything from orders
select * from orders


--especific column and rows
select name from accounts where sales_rep_id =321500


--Let's just write some queries. You will make mistakes, but that is part of the learning process!
select * from sales_reps where region_id>3
select * from web_events

--LIMIT
--Try using LIMIT yourself below by writing a query that displays all the data in the occurred_at, account_id, and channel columns of the web_events table, and limits 
--the output to only the first 15 rows.
SELECT occurred_at,account_id, channel 
FROM web_events
LIMIT 15;

--ORDER BY 
--Remember DESC can be added after the column in your ORDER BY statement to sort in descending order, as the default is to sort in ascending order.
--1 Write a query to return the 10 earliest orders in the orders table. Include the id, occurred_at, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id,account_id, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY orders
LIMIT 10

--2 Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of largest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id,account_id, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 5

--3 Write a query to return the lowest 20 orders in terms of smallest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id,account_id, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd 
LIMIT 20

--1 Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order).
SELECT id,account_id, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id,total_amt_usd DESC

--2 Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by account ID (in ascending order).

--3 Compare the results of these two queries above. How are the results different when you switch the column you sort on first?
